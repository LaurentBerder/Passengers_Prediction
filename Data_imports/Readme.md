## Objective
The objective is to change the process from being dependent on a single data provider to using various sources to compare and enrich the database.

## Sources
Data to be imported may arise from:
* Customer-delivered files (excel, etc)
* Civil aviation websites
* Aviation specialist websites (e.g. [anna.aero](http://www.anna.aero/databases/))

## Process
Creation of a repeatable (and cancellable) streamline which provides consistent and reproducible data, no matter the number and order of imported sources.
Creation of alerts on specific data-related issues.
Creation of reports at the end of each processes.
