# Passengers_Prediction
## Context
The service provided to customers (airlines and airports) is a market analysis of air passenger traffic, with a star functionality of forecasting demands for a non-yet-existing connection between two airports.
## Content
My two main missions:
* Use existing data to forecast air traffic with time series methods
* Import data from various sources (civil aviation websites, customer-provided files...) and integrate them in MongoDB for further forecasting and reporting
